## Rare-variant association studies: When are aggregation tests more powerful than single-variant tests? 

This repository contains code to perform analytic calculations and simulations from our paper. 

#### Analytic Calculations

Code to perform analytic calculations for single-variant (SV), burden, and SKAT tests can be found in `Analytic_Calculations.R`.
